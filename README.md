# 🚀 32-bit Single Cycle RISC-V Processor in Verilog

A 32-bit **Single Cycle RISC-V Processor** designed and implemented from scratch using **Verilog HDL**. This project demonstrates the fundamental architecture of a RISC-V CPU by implementing the instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages within a single clock cycle.

The processor follows a **modular design approach**, where each functional unit is implemented as an independent Verilog module, making the design easy to understand, debug, and extend.

# 📖 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design a functional **single-cycle processor** capable of executing a subset of the **RV32I instruction set**.

Unlike pipelined processors, every instruction is completed in **one clock cycle**, making the architecture simple and ideal for learning processor design and computer architecture fundamentals.

The processor performs the complete instruction execution flow:

1. Fetch the instruction from instruction memory.
2. Decode the instruction.
3. Read operands from the register file.
4. Generate the required immediate value.
5. Perform arithmetic or logical operations using the ALU.
6. Access data memory for load/store instructions.
7. Write the result back to the destination register.
8. Update the Program Counter for the next instruction.

# 🧠 Supported Instructions

The processor currently supports the following RV32I instructions:

| Instruction | Type  | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| ADD        | R-Type | Adds two registers |
| ADDI       | I-Type | Adds an immediate value to a register |
| LW         | I-Type | Loads a word from data memory |
| SW         | S-Type | Stores a word into data memory |
| BEQ        | B-Type | Branches when two registers are equal |

# 📝 Test Program

The following program was loaded into instruction memory for verification:

```assembly
addi x1, x0, 5
addi x2, x0, 10
add  x3, x1, x2
sw   x3, 0(x0)
lw   x4, 0(x0)
```

# ✅ Expected Results

After successful execution, the register values are:

| Register | Value |
|----------|-------|
| x1       | 5     |
| x2       | 10    |
| x3       | 15    |
| x4       | 15    |

Data Memory:

```
Memory[0] = 15
```

This confirms that:

- Register write operations work correctly.
- ALU performs arithmetic correctly.
- Store instruction writes data to memory.
- Load instruction retrieves data correctly.
- Write-back stage updates the destination register successfully.
